Hi, üëã I'm Jinsu Kim. I'm a Ph.D. graduate student in <a href = "https://mae.princeton.edu/">Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering</a> at Princeton University. I received my B.S.and M.S. in Nuclear Engineering and Physics at Seoul National University. My research lies at plasma physics, physics-informed scientific computing, data-driven modeling and control. 

I am very interested in the potential of machine learning application in industry. As an applied scientist intern at <a href = "https://www.gausslabs.ai/">GaussLabs</a>, I researched data-driven modeling for plasma etching and diffusion process. I am now open to any internship for computational simulation and data-driven modeling. 

My research goal is to bridge the gap between physics and machine learning, expecially in data-driven modeling and control for nonlinear dynamics. Now, I am working on two topics: Structure-preserving model order reduction for Vlasov-Possion Plasma systems, and Data assimilation for Magnetohydrodynamic systems. If you have an interest in coworking, please feel free to contact me!

My computational works are shared on the <a href = "https://github.com/zinzinbin">github link</a>. Please see and share your opinions.
